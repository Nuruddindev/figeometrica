# Figeometrica

**Figures are geometric.** Every rhetorical figure — if well defined — is an
operation over a sequence: *what operation, at which anchor, on which grain,
repeated how many times*. Figeometrica turns that thesis into executable
infrastructure.

It is a theory-compilation framework: humanistic theories of style (starting
with classical rhetoric — the world's oldest text-analysis taxonomy) compiled
into structured, machine-checkable specifications, plus engines that execute
them deterministically and auditably.

**Why does this matter?** Read the [manifesto](MANIFESTO.md) — bilingual,
five minutes.

```
figure = OPERATION × ANCHOR × GRAIN × REPETITION
         (adjectio | detractio | immutatio | transmutatio | repetitio)
         × (initial | final | insertion | whole-unit | cross-unit)
         × (grapheme | word | phrase | unit | discourse)
```

Example — `tmesis` ("abso-bloody-lutely"), as stored in
[`data/figures/tmesis.json`](data/figures/tmesis.json):

```json
{
    "anchor": "Insertion",
    "class": "Lexical",
    "grain": "word",
    "min_repeats": 1,
    "note": "insertion in the middle of a word/phrase",
    "operation": "addition",
    "template": []
  }
```

## Crates

| Crate | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`figeometrica-core`](crates/core) | Geometry spec format (`FigurePattern`, `Anchor`, `ElementClass`, slot templates with equality classes) + deterministic matcher (`GeometryMatcher`) |
| [`figeometrica-pipeline`](crates/pipeline) | Provenance-anchored analysis pipeline: modality-aware chunks, LLM observation/verification stage traits, findings with chunk+span evidence |
| [`figeometrica-rhetorica`](crates/rhetorica) | The classical-rhetoric theory base as data: figures, geometric specs, categories, loader |

## Design principles

1. **Ontology as data, not prose** — definitions compile to formal specs;
   unmet criteria are computable, so negative evidence is real.
2. **Deterministic where possible, LLM where necessary** — geometry matching
   never calls a model; models observe features and verify semantics, always
   with confidence and `indeterminate` states.
3. **Provenance everywhere** — every finding carries `chunk_id + span`.
4. **Falsifiable catalog** — a definition that cannot be written in canonical
   form is a bad definition, not a non-geometric figure.

## Status

Early development. Core matcher covers 9 patterns (anaphora, epistrophe,
symploce, anadiplosis, gradatio/climax, antimetabole, chiasmus, tmesis,
parenthesis); the rhetoric theory base is being geometrized incrementally.

## Participate

447 of 456 figures still need their geometry compiled — and the machine
checks your work: every contribution ships with example sentences that CI
runs through the deterministic matcher. No code required; one JSON file is
enough.

**How to contribute (± 15 minutes for your first figure):**

1. **Claim a figure** — open an issue with the
   ["Geometrize a figure"](../../issues/new?template=geometrize-figure.md)
   template, or pick any file in [`data/figures/`](data/figures) whose
   contract blocks are missing (e.g. `epizeuxis.json`).
2. **Fill the `signature` block** — every slot must come from the
   canonical knowledge manifest (`data/knowledge/vN`, highest N wins).
   Need a slot that doesn't exist? Propose a new knowledge version with
   the story of what demands it — see
   [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
3. **Set your ladder claim in `epistemic`** — CI re-runs the witness
   protocol itself: a claimed status without evidence fails the check.
   *No silent promotion.*
4. **Add examples** — positive sentences that *must* trigger the pattern,
   near-miss negatives that *must not*. This is what makes your entry
   machine-checkable.
5. **Check locally**
   ```bash
   cargo run -p figeometrica-rhetorica --bin sidang -- --ci
   cargo run -p figeometrica-rhetorica --bin validate
   ```
6. **Open a PR** — CI verifies automatically: pass = merged with your name
   in the entry's `attribution`; fail = you get the exact failing witness.
   Review is our Judgment Desk — merge is what ratifies a figure.

Patterns outside the matcher's current family (conceptual-class figures like
chiasmus, insertions like tmesis) are welcome too — they route to maintainer
review instead of automatic verification.

### Setup on your computer (optional)

You don't strictly need a local setup — editing the file through GitHub's
web interface and letting CI validate is enough. But running the validator
locally gives instant feedback while you iterate on examples.

Requirements: [git](https://git-scm.com) and Rust (any recent stable).

```bash
# 1. Install Rust once (~5 minutes)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# 2. Get the project
git clone https://github.com/Nuruddindev/figeomatrica.git
cd figeomatrica

# 3. Verify everything works (should end in "test result: ok")
cargo test --workspace

# 4. While contributing: check your figure file instantly
cargo run -p figeometrica-rhetorica --bin validate
```

That's all — pure Rust, no system libraries, no network access needed at
runtime. Windows users: install Rust via [rustup.exe](https://rustup.rs)
instead of the curl command.
